# Employee Attrition Analysis

This project was done as part of a university course to explore the reasons why employees leave a company.  
We used **R** to analyze the data and applied different techniques to understand the patterns.

### What we did
- **EDA**: cleaned and explored the dataset  
- **Logistic Regression**: measured the effect of salary, overtime, job satisfaction, etc.  
- **Decision Tree**: showed rules that explain attrition  
- **Clustering (K-Means) + PCA**: found hidden groups of employees with higher risk  

### Key insights
- Working overtime makes employees much more likely to leave.  
- Higher salary reduces the chance of attrition.  
- Longer relationships with managers improve retention.  
- Sales Representatives had the highest attrition rate compared to other roles.  

### Skills practiced
R programming, data cleaning, visualization, logistic regression, clustering, PCA, teamwork, and presenting results.
